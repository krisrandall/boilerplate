boilerplate
===========

Boilerplate (Standard App Template)

Unable to find a single satisfactory js framework for phone app development, I'm starting my own.

The principles of boilerplate are to provile a framework which is:
 * comprehensive
 * lightweight
 * simple

It is to provide a basic, standard appearance for an App.
The only decendency currently is jQuery.
Extra functionality like local database access or templating are problems that are already being solved really well by others (eg. http://jaydata.org/ and http://goo.gl/9Rgz0y) and should be included with your App alongside boiler plate as required.

This is my first public contribution to the open source world.
If you use boilerplate then I'd love to hear from you.

Peace!


--- NB: this project is currently at a pre-alpha stage - I'm just experimenting with my first github repo right now - i'll update this document again when the boilerplate is approaching some kind of alpha stage ---
